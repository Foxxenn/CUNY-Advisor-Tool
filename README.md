# CUNY-Advisor-Tool

This tool is designed for advisors at CUNY City Tech to assist them in choosing options for incoming students. For example, both the Math and English departments offer a wide array of choices across various categories, each leading to different paths in Math or English coursework. Additionally, it involves a complex system of if-else statements that depend on the student's responses.

Many advisory sessions with students end up on Microsoft Teams, so it would be convenient if the final format also aligns with this platform.
